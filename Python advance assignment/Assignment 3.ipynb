    "Similary a variable inside of a class also has a local variable scope. Variables which are defined in the class body (but outside all methods) are called as class level variables or class attributes. they can be referenced by there bare names within the same scope, but they can also be accessed from outside this scope if we use the attribute access operator (.). on a class or an instance of the class."
