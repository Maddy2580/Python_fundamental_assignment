    "Lambda Expressions are a short way to declare small and anonymous functions (it is not necessary to provide a name for lambda functions).It is one-line functions.It work practically the same as any other method in Python. Lambdas differ from normal Python methods because they can have only one expression, and they can't contain any statements and their return type is a function object"
